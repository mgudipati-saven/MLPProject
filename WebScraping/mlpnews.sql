      Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (“Enterprise”) (NYSE: EPD) today
      announced its financial results for the three months and year ended
      December 31, 2012. For the year ended 2012, Enterprise reported records
      for each of the following: net income of $2.4 billion; earnings per unit
      of $2.71 on a fully diluted basis; gross operating margin of $4.4
      billion; and distributable cash flow of $4.1 billion, which included
      $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from sales of assets.
    

      “Enterprise had another record year in 2012,” stated Michael A. Creel,
      president and CEO of Enterprise. “We benefited from record volumes in
      our fee-based businesses attributable to production growth, primarily in
      the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale plays, and from strong domestic and
      international demand for NGLs, particularly from the U.S. petrochemical
      industry and exports. In 2012, our integrated pipeline system
      transported a record 4.3 million barrels per day of NGLs, crude oil,
      refined products and petrochemicals and a record 14.5 trillion Btus per
      day of natural gas; while our NGL fractionators averaged a record
      659,000 barrels per day and our processing plants handled a record 4.4
      billion cubic feet per day of natural gas on a fee basis.”
    

      “We generated $4.1 billion of distributable cash flow and increased our
      cash distributions with respect to 2012 by 5.6 percent to $2.57 per
      unit. Enterprise has increased its cash distribution rate for each of
      the last 34 consecutive quarters, the longest period for any of the
      publicly traded energy partnerships, and in excess of 5 percent for each
      of the last eight years. In 2012, we retained approximately $1.9 billion
      of cash flow to reinvest in our growth projects and reduce our need to
      issue additional equity. Excluding $1.2 billion of proceeds from the
      sales of non-core assets, our distributable cash flow was $2.9 billion,
      providing 1.3 times coverage of the distributions paid with respect to
      2012,” said Creel.
    

      “In 2012, we successfully completed and began operations for major
      growth projects totaling $2.9 billion of investment. Most of these
      projects were completed on or under budget and on time or ahead of
      schedule. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed $1.2 billion
      of large projects including our sixth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu,
      Texas in October 2012 and the expansion of our natural gas and NGL
      pipeline systems serving the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas. Earlier
      this week, we began commissioning the third train at our natural gas
      processing plant near Yoakum, Texas serving Eagle Ford shale producers.
      We expect this train to begin commercial operations at the beginning of
      March. These projects are contributing new sources of gross operating
      margin and distributable cash flow, and we expect to see the full
      benefit of these assets as volumes increase over the next few years,”
      continued Creel.
    

      “Our commercial, engineering and operations teams are doing a great job
      developing growth and expansion opportunities to meet the needs of our
      energy producing and consuming customers. We have announced
      approximately $7.2 billion of major capital projects under construction
      that are scheduled to begin commercial operations from 2013 to 2015.
      Approximately $2.4 billion of these projects are expected to begin
      operations and start generating cash flow in 2013. The revenues
      associated with these projects are predominately fee-based and the
      larger projects have the additional assurance of demand revenues or
      minimum volume commitments,” stated Creel.
    

      “In 2013, we expect continuing volume and gross operating margin growth
      from our fee-based natural gas processing activities, NGL pipelines and
      fractionators and crude oil pipelines and storage facilities as these
      growth projects begin operations. We also expect our natural gas
      processing margins will be lower in 2013 than 2012 due to lower ethane
      prices, and that our equity NGL production will be lower as our natural
      gas processing business continues to transition to a more fee-based
      business. We expect the growth in our fee-based businesses will offset
      the potential decrease in gross operating margin from the commodity
      portion of our natural gas processing business and, moreover, will
      support our distribution growth in 2013,” said Creel.
    

      “Over the past three years, we have simplified our partnership structure
      to capture organizational and operational efficiencies while eliminating
      inherent conflicts of interest. We also lowered our cost of capital by
      eliminating our general partner’s incentive distribution rights. These
      actions improve the cash accretion associated with our growth capital
      projects for the benefit of our limited partners. We believe we are well
      capitalized and have good access to the capital markets to fund our
      capital program. We want to thank our debt and equity investors again
      for their continued support in 2012. Our activities are creating U.S.
      jobs and building infrastructure to support the development of North
      American energy resources that will reduce our nation’s reliance on
      imports. These investments also enhance the role and value of our
      partnership,” concluded Creel.
    

      Fourth Quarter 2012 Highlights
    

        Enterprise reported record gross operating margin of $1.2 billion,
        adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
        amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) of $1.1 billion, net income of $617
        million and earnings per unit of $0.68 on a fully diluted basis.
        Adjusted EBITDA and net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 included
        non-cash charges totaling $27 million, or a loss of $0.03 per unit on
        a fully diluted basis, for asset impairments and similar charges. This
        compares to gross operating margin of $1.1 billion, Adjusted EBITDA of
        $1.2 billion, net income of $726 million and earnings per unit of
        $0.82 on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter of 2011.
        Adjusted EBITDA and net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 included
        a net benefit of $108 million, or $0.12 per unit on a fully diluted
        basis, primarily due to gains from the sales of assets.

          Adjusted EBITDA and net income for the three months ended December
          31, 2012 included non-cash charges totaling $27 million, or a loss
          of $0.03 per unit on a fully diluted basis, for asset impairments
          and similar charges. Adjusted EBITDA and net income for the three
          months ended December 31, 2011 included a net benefit of $108
          million, or $0.12 per unit on a fully diluted basis, primarily due
          to gains from the sale of assets.
        
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
           
        
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
          For the year ended December 31, 2012, Adjusted EBITDA and net income
          included a net benefit of $18 million, or $0.02 per unit on a fully
          diluted basis, attributable to net gains from the sales of assets
          and insurance recoveries partially offset by non-cash asset
          impairment and similar charges. For the year ended December 31,
          2011, Adjusted EBITDA and net income included a net benefit of $128
          million, or $0.15 per unit on a fully diluted basis, primarily
          attributable to net gains from the sale of assets.

          Distributable cash flow for the three months ended December 31, 2012
          and 2011 included proceeds from sales of assets of $31 million and
          $593 million, respectively. Distributable cash flow for the year
          ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included proceeds from sales of
          assets of $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
        
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
           
        
      
        Enterprise increased its cash distribution with respect to the fourth
        quarter of 2012 to $0.66 per unit, or $2.64 per unit on an annualized
        basis, which represents a 6.5 percent increase from the distribution
        rate paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2011. This is the 34th
        consecutive quarterly increase and the 43rd increase since the
        partnership’s initial public offering in 1998. The distribution with
        respect to the fourth quarter of 2012 will be paid on February 7, 2013
        to unitholders of record as of the close of business on January 31,
        2013;
      
      
        Enterprise reported distributable cash flow of $886 million for the
        fourth quarter of 2012, which provided 1.5 times coverage of the $0.66
        per unit cash distribution that will be paid to common unitholders.
        Enterprise retained approximately $308 million of distributable cash
        flow for the fourth quarter of 2012. Distributable cash flow for the
        fourth quarter of 2012 included $31 million of net proceeds from sales
        of assets;
      
      
        Enterprise’s NGL, crude oil, refined products and petrochemical
        pipeline volumes for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 13 percent
        to a record 4.5 million barrels per day (“BPD”) compared to the fourth
        quarter of 2011. Total natural gas pipeline volumes were 14.2 trillion
        British thermal units per day (“TBtud”) for both the fourth quarters
        of 2012 and 2011. NGL fractionation volumes for the fourth quarter of
        2012 increased 15 percent to a record 707 thousand barrels per day
        (“MBPD”). Equity NGL production for the fourth quarter of 2012
        decreased 14 percent to 96 MBPD, while fee-based natural gas
        processing volumes for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 15 percent
        to a record 4.7 billion cubic feet per day (“Bcfd”);
      
      
        Enterprise made capital investments of approximately $1.2 billion
        during the fourth quarter of 2012, including $84 million of sustaining
        capital expenditures;
      
      
        Enterprise had consolidated liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash on
        hand and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit
        facility) at December 31, 2012 of approximately $3.2 billion; and
      
      
        Affiliates of privately-held Enterprise Products Company, which
        collectively own our general partner and approximately 38 percent of
        our outstanding limited partner interests, have expressed their
        willingness to consider investing at least $100 million during 2013 to
        purchase additional common units from Enterprise Products Partners
        L.P. The first such purchase is expected to be $25 million through the
        partnership’s distribution reinvestment plan for the distribution to
        be paid on February 7, 2013.
      
    
      Review of Fourth Quarter 2012 Results
    

      Net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $617 million versus $726
      million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income attributable to
      limited partners for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $0.68 per unit on a
      fully diluted basis compared to $0.82 per unit on a fully diluted basis
      for the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income for the fourth quarter of
      2012 included losses aggregating $27 million, or a loss of $0.03 per
      unit on a fully diluted basis, for non-cash asset impairments and
      similar charges. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 included a
      net benefit of $108 million, or $0.12 per unit on a fully diluted basis,
      primarily due to gains from the sales of assets.
    

      On January 14, 2013, we announced that the Board of Directors of
      Enterprise’s general partner approved an increase in the partnership’s
      quarterly cash distribution rate with respect to the fourth quarter of
      2012 to $0.66 per unit, representing a 6.5 percent increase over the
      $0.62 per unit rate that was paid with respect to the fourth quarter of
      2011. Enterprise generated distributable cash flow of $886 million for
      the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $1.4 billion for the fourth
      quarter of 2011. Distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2012
      included $31 million of net proceeds from the sale of assets, while
      distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2011 included $593
      million of cash proceeds from the sale of assets.
    

      Enterprise’s distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2012
      provided 1.5 times coverage of the cash distributions that will be paid
      on February 7, 2013 to unitholders of record on January 31, 2013. The
      partnership retained approximately $308 million of cash flow for the
      fourth quarter of 2012, which is available to reinvest in growth capital
      projects, reduce debt and decrease our need to issue additional equity.
    

      “The fourth quarter of 2012 demonstrated the benefits of our investments
      in fee-based businesses serving the growing shale plays. Despite our
      natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business reporting a
      $66 million decrease in gross operating margin compared to the fourth
      quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower NGL prices and equity NGL
      production, Enterprise reported record gross operating margin of $1.2
      billion for the fourth quarter of 2012 driven by record NGL, crude oil,
      refined products and petrochemical pipeline volumes of 4.5 million
      barrels per day, record NGL fractionation volumes of 707,000 barrels per
      day and record fee-based natural gas processing volumes of 4.7 billion
      cubic feet per day. This was a $61 million increase in gross operating
      margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Likewise, our
      distributable cash flow, excluding the proceeds from sale of assets, was
      also a record $855 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a $39 million
      increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Review of Segment Performance for the Fourth
      Quarter of 2012
    

      NGL Pipelines & Services – Gross operating margin for the NGL
      Pipelines & Services segment was $632 million for the fourth quarter of
      2012 compared to $635 million for the same quarter of 2011.
    

      Enterprise’s natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business
      generated gross operating margin of $330 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2012 compared to $396 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. This
      $66 million decrease was largely due to the effects of a decrease in NGL
      prices and natural gas processing margins as well as a decrease in
      equity NGL production from our Rocky Mountain, Permian Basin and East
      Texas natural gas processing plants. These decreases were partially
      offset by an increase in gross operating margin from higher fee-based
      processing volumes at our South Texas and Louisiana facilities. The
      South Texas facilities include two processing trains at our new Yoakum,
      Texas natural gas processing complex that began operations in mid-2012.
      Enterprise’s equity NGL production (the NGLs that the partnership earns
      title to as a result of providing processing services) decreased to 96
      MBPD for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 112 MBPD for the fourth
      quarter of 2011 largely due to a decrease in ethane volume extracted in
      the fourth quarter of 2012. Enterprise reported a 15 percent increase in
      fee-based processing volumes to a record 4.7 Bcfd for the fourth quarter
      of 2012 compared to 4.1 Bcfd for the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Gross operating margin from the partnership’s NGL pipelines and storage
      business increased $50 million to $220 million for the fourth quarter of
      2012 from $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Enterprise’s
      South Texas NGL pipelines, which include the new Eagle Ford NGL pipeline
      completed in mid-2012, reported a $27 million increase in gross
      operating margin on higher volumes. Gross operating margin from our NGL
      export dock on the Houston Ship Channel and a related pipeline increased
      $8 million due to higher volumes during the fourth quarter of 2012. The
      remainder of the increase in gross operating margin for this business in
      the fourth quarter of 2012 was attributable to over twenty NGL pipelines
      and storage and terminal facilities. NGL pipeline volumes were a record
      2.5 million BPD for the fourth quarter of 2012, a 269 MBPD increase from
      the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Enterprise’s NGL fractionation business reported record gross operating
      margin of $82 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $69
      million reported for the same quarter of 2011. This increase was
      attributable to a $24 million increase in gross operating margin at the
      partnership’s Mont Belvieu fractionators on a 100 MBPD increase in
      volume, which more than offset an $11 million decline in gross operating
      margin from Norco due to lower volumes and NGL prices. Enterprise began
      operations at its sixth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu in October
      2012. Fractionation volumes for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 15
      percent to a record 707 MBPD compared to the same quarter in 2011.
    

      Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services – Enterprise’s
      Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment reported an $11 million
      increase in gross operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2012 to a
      record $210 million from $199 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.
      Total onshore natural gas pipeline volumes were 13.4 TBtud in the fourth
      quarter of 2012 compared to 13.2 TBtud in the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Gross operating margin from the Texas Intrastate system increased $18
      million from the fourth quarter of 2011 on a 9 percent increase in
      pipeline volumes, including growing production from the Eagle Ford
      Shale. The Acadian Gas system reported a $14 million increase in gross
      operating margin as a result of a full quarter of operations from its
      Haynesville Extension pipeline, which began operations on November 1,
      2011. The Jonah, Haynesville, San Juan and Fairplay gathering systems
      reported an aggregate $12 million decrease in gross operating margin for
      the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 on an
      aggregate net decrease in volumes of 378 billion British thermal units
      per day (“BBtud”). Enterprise had a $5 million decrease in gross
      operating margin from our Mississippi natural gas storage facilities,
      which were sold in December 2011.
    

      Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services – Gross operating
      margin from the partnership’s Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines & Services
      segment increased to $135 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 from
      $67 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase in gross
      operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2012 was attributable to
      increased pipeline volumes, primarily on the Seaway pipeline and Eagle
      Ford production growth handled by our South Texas pipelines; improved
      results from our Cushing storage facility; and higher crude oil
      marketing volumes and margins. Total onshore crude oil pipeline volumes
      increased 32 percent to a record 897 MBPD for the fourth quarter of 2012
      from 680 MBPD for the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Offshore Pipelines & Services – Gross operating margin for
      the Offshore Pipelines & Services segment was $42 million for the fourth
      quarter of 2012 compared to $60 million for the same quarter of 2011.
    

      The Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline reported a $20 million
      decrease in aggregate gross operating margin to $14 million for the
      fourth quarter of 2012 from $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2011
      attributable to lower demand fee revenues and lower volumes. The
      Independence Hub platform earned demand fee revenues of approximately
      $4.6 million per month over a 60-month period that began when it
      commenced operations in March 2007 until that period expired in March
      2012. Natural gas volumes on the Independence Trail pipeline were 313
      BBtud for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 429 BBtud reported for
      the fourth quarter of 2011. Total offshore natural gas pipeline volumes
      (including those for Independence Trail) decreased 275 BBtud to 786
      BBtud for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of
      2011.
    

      Gross operating margin from Enterprise’s offshore crude oil pipeline
      business was $26 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $20
      million for the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to improved results
      from the Constitution, Poseidon and Cameron Highway pipelines. Total
      offshore crude oil pipeline volumes increased 54 MBPD to 336 MBPD in the
      fourth quarter of 2012 from 282 MBPD in the same quarter of 2011.
      Enterprise’s crude oil pipeline volumes for the fourth quarter of 2012
      were the highest since the federal government initiated its temporary
      drilling moratorium in June 2010.
    

      Petrochemical & Refined Products Services – Gross operating
      margin for the Petrochemical & Refined Products Services segment was
      $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $137 million in
      the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      The partnership’s propylene business reported gross operating margin of
      $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $44 million in
      the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to lower volumes and sales
      margins and higher operating expenses. Propylene fractionation volumes
      were 69 MBPD in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 75 MBPD for the
      same quarter of 2011. Related propylene pipeline volumes were 116 MBPD
      during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 119 MBPD in the fourth
      quarter of 2011.
    

      Enterprise’s butane isomerization business reported gross operating
      margin of $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $32
      million in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to a decrease in isomerization
      volumes and lower revenues from the sales of by-products. Butane
      isomerization volumes during the fourth quarter of 2012 were 93 MBPD
      compared to 106 MBPD in the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Gross operating margin for Enterprise’s octane enhancement and
      high-purity isobutylene business was $13 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2012 compared to $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 largely
      due to lower volumes as our octane enhancement plant began its annual
      turnaround in December 2012, which has historically been done in the
      first quarter. The octane enhancement plant completed its turnaround and
      returned to full operations in mid-January 2013.
    

      Enterprise’s refined products pipelines and related services business
      reported gross operating margin of $53 million for the fourth quarter of
      2012 compared to $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. This $35
      million increase in gross operating margin was largely due to lower
      operating expenses and improved performance in refined products
      marketing, which more than offset a 25 MBPD decrease in pipeline
      volumes. Pipeline volumes for this business were 589 MBPD for the fourth
      quarter of 2012 compared to 614 MPBD for the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Enterprise’s marine transportation and other services business reported
      gross operating margin of $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2012
      compared to $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Review of Other Items for the Fourth Quarter of
      2012
    

      General and administrative costs for the fourth quarter of 2012
      decreased to $40 million from $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
      General and administrative costs for the fourth quarter of 2011 included
      approximately $3 million for costs associated with the sale of the
      partnership’s Mississippi natural gas storage facilities and the merger
      with Duncan Energy Partners L.P.

      Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $199 million
      compared to $183 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to
      a higher average debt balance in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to
      the fourth quarter of 2011.
    

      Capitalization
    

      Total debt principal outstanding at December 31, 2012 was approximately
      $16.2 billion, including $1.5 billion of junior subordinated notes to
      which the nationally recognized debt rating agencies ascribe partial
      equity content. At December 31, 2012, Enterprise had consolidated
      liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash on hand and available borrowing
      capacity under our revolving credit facility) of approximately $3.2
      billion.
    

      Total capital spending in the fourth quarter of 2012 was approximately
      $1.2 billion, which includes $84 million of sustaining capital
      expenditures. We currently expect sustaining capital expenditures for
      2013 will be approximately $350 million.
    

      Tax Year 2012 K-1 Availability
    

      Enterprise expects to complete the mailing of the partnership’s Schedule

      Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      This press release and accompanying schedules include the non-GAAP
      financial measures of gross operating margin, distributable cash flow
      and Adjusted EBITDA. The accompanying schedules provide definitions of
      these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their most
      directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in
      accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be
      considered as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income,
      operating income, net cash flows provided by operating activities or any
      other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in
      accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be
      comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies because they
      may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.

          We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial
          measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in
          total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure
          of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the
          basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our
          management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among
          business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having
          access to the same financial measures that our management uses in
          evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly
          comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating
          income.
        
      
           
        
      
          We define total segment gross operating margin as operating income
          before: (1) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses; (2)
          non-cash asset impairment charges; (3) operating lease expenses for
          which we do not have the payment obligation; (4) gains and losses
          related to sales of assets and investments; (5) gains and losses
          related to property damage insurance recoveries; and (6) general and
          administrative costs. Gross operating margin by segment is
          calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net
          of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both
          segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions.
          In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are
          eliminated in consolidation. Gross operating margin is exclusive of
          other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative
          effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary
          charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100 percent basis
          before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests.
        
      
           
        
      
          We include equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our
          measurement of segment gross operating margin. Equity investments
          with industry partners are a significant component of our business
          strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to
          align our interests with those of our customers and/or suppliers.
          This method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable
          economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business
          risk assumed. Many of these businesses perform supporting or
          complementary roles to our other midstream business operations.

          We define distributable cash flow as net income or loss attributable
          to limited partners adjusted for: (1) the addition of depreciation,
          amortization and accretion expense; (2) the addition of cash
          distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates less equity
          earnings from unconsolidated affiliates; (3) the subtraction of
          sustaining capital expenditures; (4) the addition of losses or
          subtraction of gains related to sales of assets and investments and
          property damage insurance recoveries; (5) the addition of cash
          proceeds from sales of assets and investments and property damage
          insurance recoveries; (6) the addition of losses or subtraction of
          gains on the monetization of interest rate derivative instruments
          recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss); and (7)
          the addition or subtraction of other miscellaneous amounts (as
          applicable) that affect net income or loss for the period.
        
      
           
        
      
          Sustaining capital expenditures are capital expenditures (as defined
          by GAAP) resulting from improvements to and major renewals of
          existing assets. Such expenditures serve to maintain existing
          operations but do not generate additional revenues.
        
      
           
        
      
          Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to
          the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this
          metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio.
          Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure
          for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our
          success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this
          financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are
          generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an
          increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash
          flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment
          community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the
          value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield,
          which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can
          pay to a unitholder. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to
          distributable cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating
          activities.

            unconsolidated affiliates, interest expense, provision for (or
            benefit from) income taxes and depreciation, amortization and
            accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a
            supplemental financial measure by our management and external
            users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial
            banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess: (1) the
            financial performance of our assets without regard to financing
            methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; (2) the
            ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest
            and support our indebtedness; and (3) the viability of projects
            and the overall rates of return on alternative investment
            opportunities. Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all,
            items that affect net income or loss and because these measures
            may vary among other companies, the Adjusted EBITDA data presented
            in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled
            measures of other companies. The GAAP measure most directly
            comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net cash flows provided by
            operating activities.

INSERT INTO "MLPNews" VALUES(9,'EPD','Enterprise “Sells Out” PDH Facility; In Discussions for a Second PDH Facility','HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2013--
      Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) today announced that it has
      executed long-term, fee-based agreements that effectively “sell out” the
      partnership’s 1.65 billion pounds per year propane dehydrogenation
      (“PDH”) facility that is scheduled to begin operations in the third
      quarter of 2015. In anticipation of a continuing decrease in supplies of
      propylene, Enterprise is having ongoing discussions with additional
      customers that could lead to the development of additional PDH capacity.
    

      In June 2012, Enterprise announced that it was proceeding with its plans
      to build a PDH facility that would consume up to 35,000 barrels per day
      (“BPD”) of propane to produce approximately 1.65 billion pounds per year
      (approximately 750,000 metric tons per year or 25,000 BPD) of polymer
      grade propylene (“PGP”). This facility will be integrated with the
      partnership’s existing propylene fractionation facilities that have a
      capacity of 5.3 billion pounds per year (approximately 2.4 million
      metric tons or 80,000 BPD), which will provide operational reliability
      and flexibility for both the PDH unit and the fractionation facilities.
      The PDH facility will also be integrated with Enterprise’s PGP storage
      facilities, 102-mile distribution pipeline system and export terminal.
    

      “We had very strong customer demand for the remaining capacity in our
      PDH unit,” said A.J. “Jim” Teague, executive vice president and chief
      operating officer of Enterprise’s general partner. “This demand is being
      driven by the combination of a 38 percent decrease in propylene supplies
      since 2006 due to additional ethane consumption by U.S. petrochemical
      companies and the growing supplies of domestic propane from the U.S.
      shale plays. We are continuing our discussions with several customers
      that could lead to a second PDH unit or additional propylene
      manufacturing capacity.”
    

      The weighted average term of our fee-based PDH contracts is over 15
      years. These agreements are executed with customers that have, or are
      affiliated with parents that have investment grade debt ratings.
      Customers plan to consume the material with respect to three different
      derivative sectors further diversifying Enterprise’s customer base.

INSERT INTO "MLPNews" VALUES(10,'EPD','Enterprise Begins Operations at Expanded LPG Export Facility; Expands Terminal Agreement with Oiltanking Partners','HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 7, 2013--
      Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) today announced that it
      has commenced operations at its expanded export facility, increasing the
      partnership’s capability to load propane, butane and isobutane (“LPG”).
      Located on the Houston Ship Channel, the marine terminal complex is
      owned by Oiltanking Partners, L.P. (“Oiltanking”, NYSE: OILT).
      Enterprise also announced that the partnership and Oiltanking have
      significantly expanded the scope of their long-term terminal service
      agreement which runs through 2026. This relationship dates back to the
      early 1980s.
    

      The expansion of Enterprise’s export facility increases the
      partnership’s capacity to load fully refrigerated LPGs. The loading
      capacity for low-ethane propane increases from the current rate of
      almost 4 million barrels per month to approximately 7.5 million barrels
      per month. This expanded facility provides customers with improved
      access to export domestically produced LPGs to growing international
      markets.
    

      The amended terminal service agreement with Oiltanking will provide
      Enterprise additional operating flexibility including an increase in the
      number of docks available to load LPG export vessels. Access to these
      additional docks would support further expansions of Enterprise’s LPG
      export facility. Enterprise is currently evaluating an additional
      expansion that would increase the partnership’s propane export capacity
      up to 10 million barrels per month and could be in service as soon as
      the beginning of 2015.
    

      “We are pleased to complete the expansion of our LPG export facility and
      to enhance our relationship with Oiltanking,” said A.J. “Jim” Teague,
      chief operating officer of Enterprise’s general partner. “There is
      strong international demand for U.S. propane and we continue to receive
      strong indications of interest for long-term commitments from customers
      that could underwrite another expansion of the export facility.”
    

      The combination of the expanded LPG export facility and the
      partnership’s Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation and storage complex to
      which it is connected, uniquely positions Enterprise to address both the
      supply and demand side of the equation. Enterprise’s Mont Belvieu
      complex is connected to purity NGL pipelines that deliver from
      fractionators around the country, as well as many of the pipelines that
      transport mixed NGLs from the majority of the liquids-rich production
      areas in the United States. Two new NGL fractionators are currently
      under construction at Mont Belvieu that are expected to increase
      capacity to separate these mixed NGLs from approximately 485,000 barrels
      per day (“BPD”) to more than 650,000 BPD by the end of the fourth
      quarter 2013. Enterprise’s Mont Belvieu complex is also the largest NGL
      storage facility in North America, with more than 100 million barrels of
      capacity and has the capability to deliver LPGs to the partnership’s
      export facility at the high flow rates necessary to meet the loading
      requirements of international customers.
    

      Complementing the partnership’s export dock initiative is an expansion
      of the Panama Canal. Scheduled to begin operations in the second quarter
      of 2015, the project should provide Enterprise customers with greater
      flexibility, including improved access to Asian markets.
